A fire fighter’s work entails detecting and extinguishing fires. In this rapidly
evolving technological age, the world is gradually moving toward automated
systems. Firefighters, on the other hand, are often in danger of losing their lives.
The majority of the deaths were caused by toxic gases found in the firefighting
environment. As a result, in order to resolve these issues, our system was
developed.

Components Required:
---
•Arduino Board (UNO)   
•USB — A to micro-USB cable    
•Car chassis    
•L298 motor driver module     
•Flame sensor module    
•Servo Motor    
•L293D Motor Driver Module    
•Mini DC Submersible Pump    
•12V Battery    
•On-Off- Switch     
•DC Female Connector Jack    
•Connecting wires    
•Soldering iron    
•Solder wire    
•Hot Melt Glue Gun   

Required Software Applications:
---
•Arduino IDE     

How does it work?
---
The arduino is connected to a desktop/laptop and using the Arduino IDE,the
appropriate code is written and uploaded to the Arduino after compiling. One
important point to note is that the Rx and Tx pins of theBluetooth module should be
removed before uploading the code to the Arduino.

Procedure:
---
•The DC geared motors are taken and wires are soldered to both terminals
of all the motors.        
•A wooden board is taken and all the motors are attached to it.     
•The wheels are fixed to the shaft of each motor.     
•Now, the circuit connections are made according to the below circuit
diagram, The DC Motors are connected one by one to the motor driver,
and the L293D module is mounted over the Arduino Uno Board, the
Bluetooth module is also connected using the below shown circuit
diagram.     

Circuit Design:
---
Bluetooth Module to shield Connections: -    
•GND to GND    
•VCC to VCC    
•Tx to Tx    
•Rx to Rx     

Motor Driver Connections: -    

Connect the positive and negative terminals of the DC motors(4) to the DC
motor slots available in the Motor driver.

Conclusion:
---
The paper not only demonstrates the effective implementation of a firefighting robot,
but also adds new features that make it more realistic to recognize the severity of the
fire and the form of gases present, which is critical to preventing further fire spread.
